How to publish a new TMARKER version:

- rename the "dist" folder of a TMARKER compilation (tmarker.jar and lib folder) to "TMARKER", and zip it to a zip called e.g. TMARKERv2.21665.zip (i.e. the version number in the name - just to have no confusion).

- The zip file contains now one folder called TMARKER and this folder contains the jar file and the lib folder. This is important for the automatic update functionality.

- copy the zip folder here (/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/dual/nexus-dam/software/TMARKER/)

- update the vnuc.txt to the new version number (TMARKER will look at this file for the "Search for updates" functionality).

- update the download link on the Download website to the new zip file

- activate the new new zip file, the edited vnuc.txt file and the edited Download website.

Option 1: for minor revisions:
 - delete the old TMARKERvx.xxxxx.zip file

Option 2: for major revisions:
 - move the old TMARKERvx.xxxxx.zip file into the folder old_versions
 - create a new download link on the Download website under "old versions" to this moved zip file.
 - activate the changes again.
